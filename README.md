We were coding in Java using the IDE Netbeans to code for the backend.
The front end was coded using XHTML and CSS.

Our project was divided into 4 phases:

#Phase 1:

We got to write the backend of our website. we could communicate with our website through a main file.

We coded 4 models with their 4 controllers:

Food
Physical activity
Training program
User
