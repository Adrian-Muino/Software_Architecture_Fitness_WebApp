# Software-Architecture-Fitness_WebApp

This project was made in the context of a master class in Software Architectecture.

As a group of 4 students working on this project, we decided to come up with a fitness web app that would integrate Pokemon graphics and other popular memes.

The goal of this web app was to practice our programming language JAVA, XHMTL and CSS. Also, it was an opportunity to apply Model–view–controller (MVC) as software architectural pattern and MySQL to manage our RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). For this project we had the constraint to use NetBeans IDE and Payara Servers.

## Phase 1:

Set-up of the environment. \n
Write the backend of our website (create our models & and controllers). \n
Code four models (Food / Physical activity / Training program / User) with their respective controllers.
Use NetBeans terminal to execute our app on premise.

## Phase 2:

Write code to handle errors and unit tests.
Set-up the Payara Server.
Build & deploy the front end (views) of our website coded in XHTML and CSS.

## Phase 3:

Extract and load datasets into MySQL.
Connect our backend to our RDBMS.
Review our models to retrieve and transform properly the data.

## Phase 4:

Split the code into a RestFulService & RestFulClient.
Connect the two servers using REST APIs to allow both servers to communicate with each other through RestAPI and process the responses accordingly.
Deploy the final version & presentation.
