In this project I was involved in a team of 4 students we decided to do a fit app with the graphics of Pokemon.

We were coding in Java using the IDE Netbeans to code for the backend.
The front end was coded using XHTML and CSS.

Our project was divided into 4 phases:

## Phase 1:

We got to write the backend of our website. we could communicate with our website through a main file.

We coded 4 models with their 4 controllers:

Food
Physical activity
Training program
User

## Phase 2:

In this phase, the objective was to build the front end of our website using XHTML and CSS code

## Phase 3:

In this phase, we connected our website to a large database using SQL and MYSQL.

## Phase 4:

In this phase, we separated the front end from the back end and made the two websites communicate through RestAPI with each other.
